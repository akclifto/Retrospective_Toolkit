### Introduction

This Retrospective Toolkit (the "Toolkit") is the product of Team 18's capstone project.  The toolkit will be used as a training tool by our sponsor and will contain two base activities: a cube activity and a model-building activity.

The functional aspects of the Toolkit are separated into three areas: (1) frontend components, (2) backend components, and (3) cloud-hosting and database components.  This document will cover the topics and technology used in the project.

### Build Instructions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To initialize dependencies before running:

#### `yarn`

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start-server`

and then

#### `yarn start-client`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/): Webpack compiles multiple .js files into one file to load into scripts when starting the app.
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/): Makes package, scripting and dependency management easier.
